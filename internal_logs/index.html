<p><strong>> NEW ENTRY DETECTED...</strong></p>

<p><span class="timestamp">[NOV 22 - 08:15 AM]</span></p>
<p>He didn't come home last night. I drove to the studio at 6 AM. The door was locked from the inside.</p>

<p>I could hear him over the intercom system. He wasn't speaking. He was... humming? But it sounded "wet." Like his mouth was full of liquid.</p> 

<p>I checked the network traffic. He uploaded a file called <code>path_a.html</code> to the server around 3 AM. I read the instructions. <strong>He thinks he's controlling it.</strong></p>

<p>I'm going to cut the power to the building. If the stream goes down, you know why.</p>

<p><strong>> ARCHIVED ENTRY...</strong></p>

<p><span class="timestamp">[NOV 21 - 03:42 AM]</span></p>
<p>I don't know how Alex changed the main website text. I locked him out of the admin panel yesterday. I checked the Git logs—the changes came from <em>inside</em> the server. The IP address listed is 0.0.0.0.</p>

<p>He keeps talking about "The Guide." He says Page 88 has instructions on how to "open the throat."</p>

<p>I managed to recover one audio file before he wiped the drive. It's raw. You can hear the second voice.</p>
